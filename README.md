This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of the React Native project:

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of the React Native project. Run the following command to start our _iOS_ app:

### For iOS

```bash
# using Yarn
yarn ios
```

You should see the new app running in your _iOS Simulator_ shortly.
You can also run it directly from within Xcode.


## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the App. :partying_face:
